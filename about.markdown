As a dynamic backend developer with a rich blend of academic and industry experience, my expertise extends across a diverse array of computer science domains. My technical prowess is rooted in a variety of technologies including Python, Golang, Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL with PostGIS, complemented by strong data processing capabilities through tools like pandas and numpy.

My academic journey at the University of Victoria (UVIC) involved in-depth exploration of peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, blockchain, and distributed systems. This graduate work not only fortified my technical foundations but also fueled my passion for innovation and exploration in various fields of computer science. My involvement in key open-source projects such as 'stac-fastapi-elasticsearch', 'stac-check', and 'stac-validator' demonstrates my ability to lead and contribute to complex technological solutions.

While my background includes a specialization in geospatial application backends, my skill set and interests are not confined to this area. I am enthusiastic about applying my knowledge and experience to new and challenging fields within computer science. My approach integrates a blend of academic insights and practical problem-solving skills, making me adaptable to various technological landscapes.

Collaboration and lifelong learning form the cornerstone of my professional approach. I thrive in environments that challenge me to architect robust solutions, whether in familiar territories or entirely new fields. My goal is to contribute meaningful advancements to the broader technology community, focusing on creating solutions that are not only innovative but also impactful and accessible to users.
